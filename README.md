# Description

This [guardrails] validator provides support for[cucumber-expressions], a simpler, more readable "regular expression" dialect with the following features:

* Supports built-in `parameter_type`(s) for common types, like: `{int}`, `{float}`, ...
* Supports user-defined `parameter_type`(s) with own `regular expressions`, type conversion and transformation
* Supports alternative text, like: `apple/orange` (matches: `apple` or `orange`)
* Support optional text, like: `apple(s)` (matches: `apple`, `apples`)

This validator is similar to [regex_match], but often easier to use because:

* [cucumber-expressions] are often more readable (especially for people that are less familiar with `regular expressions`)
* less error-prone, because a readable placeholder(s) are used for the complex regular expression.

# Installation

```bash
$ guardrails hub install hub://guardrails/cucumber_expression_match
```

# Usage Examples

## Validating string output via Python

In this example, we apply the validator to a string output generated by an LLM.

```python
# -- FILE: use_guardrails_cucumber_expression_match.py
from guardrails import Guard, OnFailAction
from guardrails.hub import CucumberExpressionMatch
from cucumber_expressions.parameter_type import ParameterType

# -- SETUP GUARD:
positive_number = ParameterType("positive_number", regexp=r"\d+", type=int)
guard = Guard().use(CucumberExpressionMatch(
    expression="I buy {positive_number} apple(s)/banana(s)/orange(s)",
	parameter_types=[positive_number],
        on_fail=OnFailAction.EXCEPTION
))

# -- VALIDATOR PASSES: Good cases
guard.validate("I buy 0 apples")    # Guardrail passes
guard.validate("I buy 1 apple")     # Guardrail passes
guard.validate("I buy 1 banana")    # Guardrail passes
guard.validate("I buy 2 bananas")   # Guardrail passes
guard.validate("I buy 1 orange")    # Guardrail passes
guard.validate("I buy 3 oranges")   # Guardrail passes

# -- VALIDATOR FAILS: Bad cases
try:
    guard.validate("I buy 2 melons")    # Guardrail fails: Unexpected fruit
    guard.validate("I buy -10 apples")  # Guardrail fails: Negative number
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
```
